  <h1>Embedding a Service-Hosted Video into Your Website</h1>

  <p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of embedding a video hosted on a service like YouTube or Vimeo into your website.</p>

  <h2>1. Find the Embed Code</h2>
  <p>The first step is to locate the embed code for the video you want to share. Visit the video hosting platform and navigate to your desired video. Look for a "Share" or "Embed" button. Clicking this button will typically reveal a code snippet.</p>

  <p>Once you've found the embed code, copy the entire text snippet. You'll paste this code into your website's HTML later.</p>

  <h2>3. Edit Your Website's HTML</h2>
  <p>Most website creation tools allow you to edit the HTML code directly. Locate the section of your webpage where you want the video to appear and switch to the HTML editing view.</p>

  <h2>5. Save and View Your Website</h2>
  <p>Save the changes you made to your website's HTML code. Once saved, view your website to see the embedded video. It should now appear on your webpage, ready for your visitors to enjoy.</p>
